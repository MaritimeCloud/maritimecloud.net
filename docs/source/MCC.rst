MCP Consortium (MCC)
====================
MCP consortium (MCC) governs the standards relating to MCP, including the MCP source code. The MCC operates a testbed for MCP (done by a member on behalf of the consortium), but does not operate an operational instance of the MCP.

* `RISE, Sweden <https://www.ri.se/>`_
* `University of Copenhagen, Denmark <https://www.ku.dk/>`_

* `Swedish Maritime Administration <https://www.sjofartsverket.se/en/>`_
* `Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea <https://www.mof.go.kr/eng/index.do>`_

The terms of the consortium can be found in the `consortium arrangement document <https://maritimeconnectivity.net/docs/Consortium_arrangement_1-1-1_clean.pdf>`_.
