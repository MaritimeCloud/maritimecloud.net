Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP) documentation
==========================================================

This documentation describes Maritime Connectivity Platform from the overall architecture to the technical details of the MCP reference implementation.

This primarily aims to cover the technical parts of MCP. If you are not familiar with MCP we encourage you to read `MCP official webpage <https://maritimeconnectivity.net/>`__ that gives the idea of MCP in more high level.

Please refer `our Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maritimeconnectivity>`__ for general usage questions and new releases.
