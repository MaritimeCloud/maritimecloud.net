Using MCP Testbed
===================
In order to get an organization in our testbed, its users and any ships the organization might own on to the MCP testbed, the organization needs to perform a signup process.
The process is currently manual. To start the process, please fill out the `registration form <https://management.maritimecloud.net/#/apply>`__.

Once your organization has been approved you will have access to MCP and its services.
You should probably start by looking at the `Management Portal <https://management.maritimecloud.net/>`__.
